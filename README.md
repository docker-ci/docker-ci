# docker-ci

## Docker-ci - an ultimate solution to managing docker containers

Say you want to launch multiple containers and link them together. Sounds easy, right? But what if you need to clean stopped containers? Ensure container is running? Kill or remove container and build another one? Validate container? Run tests? Use specific environment?

This tool does it all.

Docker-ci is an open source project, that brings transparency and consistency to your project

---

It runs your commands in sequence: kill, remove, create volume, run, build. They are simple, powerful and bring convinience to your build
